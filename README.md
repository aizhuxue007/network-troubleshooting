# Network Troubleshooting Simulation
## 1. Setting Up Virtual Network
- Step 1: Create multiple VMs in AWS with both Linux and Windows.
- Step 2: Configure network settings for each VM to simulate a real network environment, ensuring they can communicate.
## 2. Simulating Network Problems
- Step 1: Introduce common network issues like IP conflicts or DNS misconfigurations.
- Step 2: Use tools like ping, `tracert`/`traceroute`, and `nslookup` to diagnose issues.
## 3. Analyzing and Resolving Issues
- Step 1: Apply fixes based on your diagnostics, adjusting network configurations as necessary.
- Step 2: Use Wireshark to analyze traffic and verify the resolution of issues.
