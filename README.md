#Network Troubleshooting Simulation
1. Setting Up Virtual Network
2. Step 1: Create multiple VMs in VirtualBox or AWS with both Linux and Windows.
Step 2: Configure network settings for each VM to simulate a real network environment, ensuring they can communicate.
3. Simulating Network Problems
Step 1: Introduce common network issues like IP conflicts or DNS misconfigurations.
Step 2: Use tools like ping, tracert/traceroute, and nslookup to diagnose issues.
4. Analyzing and Resolving Issues
Step 1: Apply fixes based on your diagnostics, adjusting network configurations as necessary.
Step 2: Use Wireshark to analyze traffic and verify the resolution of issues.


2. Network Troubleshooting Simulation
Creating a Virtual Network in AWS
VPC Setup: Navigate to VPC Dashboard > Create a new VPC for your network simulation environment.
Simulating Network Problems and Solutions
Network Challenges: Within your VPC, introduce common network issues (e.g., IP conflicts, DNS misconfigurations) > Use AWS instances to diagnose and resolve.
